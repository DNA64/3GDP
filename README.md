**iPhone 3G Baseband Downgrader Pro v1.3.5 for BB 02.30.03 by DNA64**

*04/15/2009*

**Please keep in mind this is only for iPhone 3G's running the 2.2.1 (5H11) Firmware with the 02.30.03 BaseBand, and the 5.08 (5.8) Boot Loader.**

## About

After testing phasebanddowngrader by pH and not having any success I decided to skip using his script and start fresh using the GeoHotz bspatch method which I applied to the ICE2_02.28.00.fls file, the end results were success! I have therefore decided to write my own script, as I felt pH left out some very important features from his. I also tried "DownBB" with no success, and felt that there was not enough documentation for any of these tools. Comments by several users that tried and failed seemed to support my theory.

## Instructions

**Installation:**

Run ./downgrade from the MobileTerminal application (or via SSH) and follow the on screen directions.

**Uninstalling:**

Run ./uninstall from the MobileTerminal application (or via SSH) and follow the on screen directions.
*(The uninstall script included will remove all files installed, created, or downloaded.)*

## Credits

Thanks to GeoHot and all the iPhone Dev Team members for all their hard work,
without them and GeoHot's bspatch the downgrade would not be possible.

yellowsn0w was created by members of the iPhone Dev Team.
The unofficial version 0.98 is included with these tools,
but is not supported by the team and is provided as is.
